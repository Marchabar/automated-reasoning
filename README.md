# Problem Solving with Z3 Solver

This repository contains solutions to a variety of optimization and logic-based problems using the [Z3 solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), a high-performance theorem prover developed by Microsoft Research. The problems range from simple constraints to more complex scenarios, showcasing the power and flexibility of Z3 in solving them.

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the Z3 solver for Python by running the following command:

```bash
pip install z3-solver
```

For visualizing the **Poster Printing Problem**, we use the `plotly` library. You can install it by running:

```bash
pip install plotly
```

With these installations, youâ€™ll be ready to explore the solutions provided and run the visualizations.
